## Not Working For All Songs
## Spotify Search API doesn't always return the correct title and artist if you input the youtube title of the song (youtube title is formatted way differently than the spotify one so it has trouble searching) . Sometimes it returns a remix version and the artist is listed as someone else.



## Requirements: Create A Spotify App using the Spotify API and enter in your client id and client secret
